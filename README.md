# Shapes

School final project that I wish was harder

## Requirements

* Driver, Main, Runner, etc...
* Two lists
* Different object for each list
* Both object lists should have data that is in common. For some reason though, we aren't using an interface or storing both of them inside of a more relevant list. (Not utilizing what we learned, in my opinion)
* UML Diagram prior to coding, must propose topic to teacher

## Building

### Build Requirements

* Java 8
* Ant

### To build...

Build *Shapes*, with the following

<pre>
$ ant
</pre>

And then, run the jar

<pre>
$ java -jar Shapes.jar
</pre>
