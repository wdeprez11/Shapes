# Shapes

School final project that I wish was harder

## TODO

* Get a better idea
* Create a UML graphic
* Implement doxygen
* Buffered Reader
* ...
* and More

## Requirements

* A Driver, Main, Runner, etc... class
* Two ArrayLists
* Different object for each list
* Both object lists should have data that is in common. For some reason though, we aren't using an interface or storing both of them inside of a more relevant list. This project really doesn't utilize the full capacity of what we learned in my opinion, but I still want 100.
* UML Diagram prior to coding, must propose topic to teacher

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Ant

### Using Shapes

Build *Shapes*, with the following

<pre lang="sh">
$ ant
</pre>

And then, run the jar

<pre lang="sh">
$ java -jar Shapes.jar
</pre>
